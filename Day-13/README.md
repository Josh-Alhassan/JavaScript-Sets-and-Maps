# Console Object Methods
We use console object methods to show output on the browser console and we use <code>document.write()</code> to show output on the browser document (view port). Both methods used only for testing and debugging purposes.

The console method is the most popular testing and debugging tool on the browser. The <code>document.getElementById()</code> when we like to intereact with DOM using JavaScript.

In addition to the famous, <code>console.log()</code> method, the console provides other more methods.
