# Classe

JavaScript is an object oriented programming language. Everything in JavaScript is object, with it's properties and methods. We create class to create an object. A class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behaviour of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class.

Creating an object from a class is called ***class instantiation***.

Object literal is a singleton. If we want to get a similar object, we have to write it. However, class allows to create many objects. This helps reduce the amount of code and repetition of code.

## Defining a classes
To define a class in JavaScript we need the keyword *class*, the name of a class in *camelCase* and block code(two curly brackets).

```
// syntax
class ClassName {
    // code goes here
}
```
